# Extracting ROS Communication Architecture Reconfiguration From ROS Bag Files

This repository contains the replication package and dataset of the paper submitted to RobotSoftwareArchitecture@ICRA 2023.

This study has been designed, developed, and reported by the following investigators:

- [Michel Albonico](https://michelalbonico.github.io/) (Federal University of Technology, Paran√° - UTFPR)
- [Berry Chen](#) (Student@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
- [Ivano Malavolta](https://www.ivanomalavolta.com) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)

In this project, we aim to extract time-windowed architectural information from [ROS bag files](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag). Our approach is an alternative to dynamic extractors, such as native [rqt_graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph) tool, which are not trivial to be executed since they require a running ROS environment. 

This repository is organized as following:

```
       docker/    - Contains the Dockerfile for an with a ROS basic installation.
  src/git_api/    - Contains the code used to crawl GitHub repositories (no documentation on this).
src/extractor/    - Contains the source code of the architecture extractor.
```

Before starting, if you want to check a dynamic extraction ([rqt_graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph)), it is necessary to create the Docker image:
```
$ cd docker/
$ docker build -t ros-extractor .
$ docker run -it ros-extractor bash
```

Note that it is not necessary for our architecture extractor, which is independent of platforms. However, it requires a few dependencies, solved by the following commands:

```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
$ sudo apt install graphviz
```

Then, just run the extraction script on a bagfile: 
```
python3 extract_graph.py /path/file
```

Here, we provide and example with a very simple file:
```
python3 src/extract_graph.py ./turtlesim.bag
```

The expected result is the following image:

## Public Bagfiles

- In [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HwNHiVZJhChzVv4ZwMy9yN5gWYnwAsSi?usp=sharing) shared folder, you will find some bagfiles from our team experiments with ROS+SLAM.
- We have also used the [MET dataset](https://starslab.ca/enav-planetary-dataset/) for our tool validation. It contains huge bagfiles from a rover robot navigation.
- [This](#) spreadsheet contains all the public bagfiles we found on GitHub.

## ROS in general
ROS documentation: http://wiki.ros.org
ROS tutorials : http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials

**Only ROS1 is used in this project.**

There are 3 common used instructions in this project, namely [roscore](http://wiki.ros.org/roscore), [rosbag record](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline), and [rqt_graph](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph)

- `roscore` starts a master node in ROS environment, where default node `rosout`, topics `rosout` and `rosout_agg` are present. It is necessary to run `roscore` before taking any further actions in ROS environment. Before running `roscore`, we need to source the *setup.bash* script at the beginning on every new terminal where ROS is intended to use, then ROS master can be started. 
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roscore
```

- `rosbag record` only records the messages that published **on** the topics, resulting in a binary format bagfile with fields such as name, msg, and topics.

Fields in a rosbag file:

- `rqt_graph`, which works based on ROS environment, provides computational graphs while executing bagfiles. If no file is running, the computational graph only consists of a the default node and topics, combining with the topic `statistics` and node `rqt_gui_py_node_id` which are triggered by command `rqt_graph`

## Extracting information from ROS bags
By using python and its package [bagpy](https://jmscslgroup.github.io/bagpy/), messages stored in the bagfiles can be read and decoded. Topics presented in the bagfile can be extracted by using `b.topic_table,` where `b` is a bagreader object. Then, we need first to check whether `rosout` is in the topic table or not. If not, the architecture information cannot be extracted with our approach. Otherwise, the information needed to generate a computational graph can be extracted, and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) is used to connect and visualize the graph.

## Validation
Comparing to the dynamic approach(rqt_graph), our static approach workds totally independent on ROS environment. Validation process are done by manually checking the graphs of each bagfiles in the validation set and compare the differences between two approaches' graphs.



<!--## Result
By applying our static approach to the 242 bagfiles obtained from GitHub, it is found that most bagfiles can be extracted without any problem. Also, problems occurred within 49 bags where the main node `/rosout` is not recorded in the bag.

<!-- ## Requirements
Before running the graph extraction, you must install a basic ROS1 environment. Follow [this](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) tutorial.

In Ubuntu, after setting the apt-get souce, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install ...
```
